## [Introduction](https://github.com/Tejasri-123/Ecommerce/blob/main/README.md#introduction)

Fashion Fuse is an ecommerce web application designed to provide users with a convenient and 
user-friendly platform for browsing and purchasing fashion products. The application includes 
features for both users and administrators, allowing for seamless management of products and 
orders. 

## [Features](https://github.com/Tejasri-123/Ecommerce/blob/main/README.md#features)

**User Signup and Login**: New users can create an account by providing their name, email address, 
and password. They can securely log in using their email address and password, with JWT token 
included for security. 

**Product Browsing**:Users can easily navigate through different product categories such as men, 
women, kids, and accessories. Information about each product, including images, description, 
and price, is displayed.

**Cart Management and Order Placement**: Users can add products to their cart with a single click. 
A summary of the items in the cart is displayed for easy reference. Users can then confirm their 
order and make a purchase through the application. 

**Admin Section**: Administrators have access to a separate section where they can manage user 
data and add products to the application. They can add new products, update existing product 
information, and remove products that are no longer available.

## [Technologies Used](https://github.com/Tejasri-123/Ecommerce/blob/main/README.md#technologies-used)

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: PHP
- Database: MySQL
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Hosting: AWS EC2
  
## [Architecture](https://github.com/Tejasri-123/Ecommerce/blob/main/README.md#architecture)

**Frontend**: The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The frontend of the application, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is enhanced with the use 
of the CSS library Bootstrap. Bootstrap provides pre-designed components and styles that help 
in creating a responsive and visually appealing user interface. 

**Backend**: The backend is powered by PHP, which handles user authentication, product 
management, and order processing. 
On the backend, PHP is used to handle user authentication, product management, and order 
processing. PHP scripts interact with the MySQL database to store and retrieve user data, product 
information, and order details. PHP also integrates with the front end to dynamically generate 
content and manage user sessions. 

**Database**: The application uses MySQL database to store user data, product information, and 
order details. 
The MySQL database is used to store all the necessary data for the ecommerce platform. It is 
structured to efficiently store and manage data, ensuring fast and reliable access to information. 
The database schema includes tables for storing user accounts, product details, and order 
information, with relationships defined between them to maintain data integrity.

## [Database Schema And Setup Instruction](https://github.com/Tejasri-123/Ecommerce/blob/main/README.md#database-schema-and-setup-instructions)

 ### Database Schema 
The database schema I have designed for the Ecommerce Apllication as shown in the below picture
